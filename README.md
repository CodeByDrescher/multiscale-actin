# Template Vivarium Project

Visit [the Vivarium Core
documentation](https://vivarium-core.readthedocs.io/) to learn how to
use the core Vivarium engine to create computational biology models.
Check out the
[getting started](https://vivarium-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html)
guide of the documentation.

## Using this Template

This repository contains a skeleton project you can build on to create
your own models. Go to the
[github page](https://github.com/vivarium-collective/vivarium-template)
and select `use this template`.

## Getting Started

Please ensure that you make adjustments to the following files with your own information:

- `setup.py`: Update this file with all of your PyPI package/module information.
- `requirements.txt`: Add any of your simulator-specific dependencies here, for example: `tellurium`.
- `pytest.ini`: It is crucial that you update the `testpaths` field in this file once you update the primary package
  folder, which is `./template` in this current template format.

What follows is a template `README.md`.
